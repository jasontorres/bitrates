Download & Installation
--------
Get the latest version of the application here:

[Download the latest version here](http://jasontorres.s3.amazonaws.com/stuff/bitrates.app.zip)

Drag the application to your /Applications directory.

Since this is distributed manually, you need to allow the application.
Go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Click "Open Anyway" to allow it.

All source code is available here on github. Feel free to send a PR if you want to add your local market.

Feel free to modify and build your own. However, it requires a Rubymotion license which you can purchase at [rubymotion.com](http://www.rubymotion.com)
